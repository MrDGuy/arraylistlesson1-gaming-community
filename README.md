#  Community Class with ArrayList of Players

Create a `Community` class that contains an `ArrayList` of players that are part of a gaming community.

---

##  TO DO #1: Write the `Community` class with the following:

- An instance variable to represent a list of `Player` objects  
- A constructor that initializes the list to an empty list  
- An accessor method that returns the list of `Player` objects  
- A method called `addPlayer()` that adds a `Player` to the list  

---

##  TO DO #2: In the `CommunityRunner` class:

1. Instantiate a `Community` object.  
2. Call the `addPlayer()` method to add players to the list.  
3. Call the accessor method and print the result.

 **TIP**: Check out the documentation for the `ArrayList` class in the **Documentation** tab  for help with declaring and initializing an `ArrayList` and using the `add()` method.
